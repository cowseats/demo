# Press Release Feed Code

The nasdaq news file pulls a feed that goes from this year, which will update year automatically to five years ago. If the years back ever needs to be changed it is line **23**, change the 5 to the number of years back desired.

There is a possibility of nulls showing up, simply use this line **62** as an example of how to fix that for the element displaying a null.
